# Tuckshop App 
I started and completed this project in my second to last year of high school, and was awarded the NZQA Technology Scholarship for it in 2022. 

## Project Overview 
To address the need for a more efficient and user-friendly way to manage school tuckshop orders, I developed the School Tuckshop App. This app aimed to streamline the ordering process for students, staff, and parents, providing an easy-to-use interface to view menu items and recieve real-time updates from the tuckshop. It also allowed the tuckshop admins to add and change menu items and specials for the day. 

### Key Features
- Menu Display: Browse available tuckshop items with descriptions and prices
- Updates Page: See real-time updates from the tuckshop (e.g., menu items sold out).
- Admin Management: Admins can add, update, and manage menu items and specials.
- Info Page: Provides additional information about the tuckshop and its operations.

### Technologies Used
Frontend: React Native
Backend: Firebase (for user authentication, order management, and admin features)
